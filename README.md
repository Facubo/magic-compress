# Magic compressor 
A video compressor that feels like black magic.

## Project Description

The idea behind this is to create a program capable of striping as many unperceptible data as possible from a video file.
I plan to support mainstream formats such as mp4, avi, wmv, flv, mkv and gif.

Ever felt your video should weight way less?
well, there might be a reason for that.
